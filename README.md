# Coursework Assignment

## Overview

This repository is part of a coursework assignment aimed at assessing the following module learning outcomes:

1. **Model Construction & Application Development**: Build models of the problem domain and develop appropriate applications.
2. **Software Artefact Management**: Manage project software artefacts incorporating quality metrics and practices.
3. **Test Strategy Design**: Design test strategies using current technologies.
4. **Full Lifecycle Software Engineering**: Engineer software systems throughout their lifecycle, with a focus on evolution.

## Project Scenario

A small haulage company requires a cross-platform application to manage its operations, servicing a network of customers who exchange goods. The app will handle tasks such as customer account management, billing, pickup and delivery requests, trip management, and more. The application is being developed in C# MAUI, with data stored in a central MSSQL database.

## Project Requirements

- **Development Framework**: C# MAUI for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Data Storage**: Central MSSQL database.
- **Team Size**: 3-4 members, with individual assessment based on contribution.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - User story elaboration and documentation in GitHub issues.
  - UML modeling and version-controlled documentation.
  - Feature development and unit testing.
  - Code quality documentation using appropriate metrics.
  - Adherence to GitHub workflow including branching, pull requests, and code reviews.
  
## Development Requirements 

- Every feature or bug fix should have a separate branch.
- Every change is subject to unit tests being run.
- Updates to unit tests are required if the change affects them.

## Contribution Requirements

Each team member must complete three development tasks, each focusing on one of the key actors (customer, driver, administrator). Additionally, team members must:
- Document the team's branching strategy.
- Conduct three code reviews for other team members.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit a PDF documenting work on three issues, with descriptive text, diagrams, and links to relevant GitHub items.
- The submission must include an introduction, summaries of each issue, UML diagrams, code descriptions, unit test summaries, and details of code reviews conducted.
